Building reliable IT infrastructure does not have to be complex or expensive for small and mid-size organizations.

This guide outlines the foundational components you should standardize early: server platform, backup tooling, network segmentation, monitoring, and basic security hardening.

In future articles we will dive deeper into standard operating procedures, documentation practices, and automation opportunities.
