Backup and disaster recovery planning protects business continuity against hardware failure, ransomware, accidental deletion, and site-level incidents.

Critical elements include:

- Clear Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) targets.
- Offsite or immutable backup storage.
- Regular restore testing—verifying you can recover is as important as taking backups.
- Documented procedures for who does what during an incident.

Without tested recovery processes, backups become a false sense of security. Start small: define targets, implement a dependable backup platform (e.g. Veeam), and schedule quarterly restoration drills.

Future content will cover designing tiered recovery strategies, replication, and protecting backup infrastructure itself.
